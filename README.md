# Python-Tutorial
This note is for a project based tutorial on python and Data Wrangling with pandas.
All Data used in each of the Jupyter note tutorial is a csv file which can also be found in the folder.
This note was created by me for Class 1 student at STEM Zone so topics might not be sequential but according to how the classes are taught
